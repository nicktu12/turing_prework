# Statify

Statify is an application built to display a Spotify user's listening statistics on a visual and interactive dashboard. Using the Spotify API, users are able to see different data sets over different periods of time. Statify was build using React, Redux and Router, with asynchronous API calls managed through Redux-Sagas.

API calls to the Spotify database are accomplished with a Node/Express backend. The client id and secret id are hidden using dotenv.

To start the application on `localhost:3000`, enter the following command.

npm start
